<h2>About</h2><p>We all know higher studies cost a fortune. Choosing the BEST one making sure it
meets your budget and needs, can be very challenging and stressful.
<br>
<br> For this purpose, I created an app which scraps big data from Top 100 ranked graduation
schools, to compare on the basis of their Tuition, Living Costs, Rankings and Acceptance
rates. I used Python Pandas for Data Analysis and Matplotlib for Data Visualization. </p>
